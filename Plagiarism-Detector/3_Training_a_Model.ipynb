    "Looking at the problem in question I knew previously that it was a classification problem, where the output will be 1 or 0. For this type of problems there are several models in the sklearn library, so we clearly have the possibility to choose the most suitable model for our problem. \n",
    "So knowing the data model, I chose as the final model a **Support Vector Classification** (SVC) model, because after some tests with other models (_KNeighborsClassifier_, _MLPClassifier_, among others) I realized that the SVC model, for my data set, was the one that presented the best precision. However, I also ended up using some hyperparameters.\n",
    "In conclusion, the accuracy of the model is very good."
