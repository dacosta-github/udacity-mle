## Consumer Complaint Database

For this project I will use a dataset called **Consumer Complaint Database** (Consumer Finance Complaints (Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection)) which can be downloaded from Kaggle [1] or Data.gov [2].

“These are real world complaints received about financial products and services. Each complaint has been labeled with a specific product; therefore, this is a supervised text classification problem. With the aim to classify future complaints based on its content, we used different ML algorithms can make more accurate predictions (i.e., classify the complaint in one of the product categories). The dataset contains different information of complaints that customers have made about a multiple products and services in the financial sector, such us Credit Reports, Student Loans, Money Transfer, etc. The date of each complaint ranges from November 2011 to May 2019”[1].
